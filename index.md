# [Introduction to spatial analysis of ecological data using R (ISPE04)](https://www.prstatistics.com/course/introduction-to-spatial-analysis-of-ecological-data-using-r-ispe04/)

## Prerequisites

[Course prerequisites](Prerequisites.html)

## Course materials

Every day, a part of course materials (slides, scripts, exercises, datasets, etc.) will be shared with all of the participants.

## Distant time zones

Lectures will be live recorded and shared with all of the participants.
Usually it takes about two hours for all of the videos to be processed.
Therefore, I will try to share recordings around 7PM (UTC +2) each day.

## Planned schedule
